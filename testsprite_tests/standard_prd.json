    "File Explorer integrated for file and folder creation, renaming, and deletion within projects.",
    "Integrated Output Console showing code execution results including stdout, stderr, and execution time.",
    "AI Chat Panel for contextual code assistance with quick actions like explain, fix, optimize and generate code.",
    "Python Code Execution via sandbox API with support for popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy.",
    "Data Upload for CSV/Excel files with AI-powered cleaning and plotting triggered by natural language prompts.",
    "Integrated Terminal for advanced environment and package management.",
    "File Upload with drag-and-drop and validation supporting direct project file tree integration.",
    "Centralized state management using Zustand for maintaining editor, projects, files, and user session states.",
    "Admin Panel for system and user management.",
    "Database persistence using MySQL for all user, project, file, chat, and execution data."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "First Time User: Landing Page → Get Started → Sign Up → Access Dashboard → Create Project → Open Editor → Write Code → Run Code → View Output.",
    "Data Analysis Flow: Dashboard → Open Project → Upload CSV/Excel File → Send AI Prompt for cleaning and plotting → AI generates Python code → Run Code → View Results.",
    "AI Assistance Flow: Write code in editor → Encounter error or need help → Use AI Chat panel to explain/fix/optimize code → Apply AI suggestions → Run code again.",
    "Project Management: From Dashboard → Create, Rename, Search, Open or Delete Projects → Manage project files with File Explorer.",
    "Authentication Flow: Signup/Login → JWT session creation → Access protected routes → Logout to end session."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Users must successfully sign up and log in with valid credentials and JWT session management.",
    "Users can create, open, rename, and delete projects with persistence in the database.",
    "Code execution must run in a sandbox with timeouts and return accurate stdout/stderr and execution time.",
    "AI chat interface must respond with contextual code assistance including explaining, fixing, and optimizing code or generating new code upon prompt.",
    "CSV and Excel uploads must parse correctly, AI must generate cleaning and visualization code in response to natural language prompts, and code must execute successfully.",
    "File operations including create, rename, delete and auto-save work reliably without data loss.",
    "UI must remain responsive across device types with no broken layouts and clear error/loading states.",
    "System must secure passwords using bcrypt, use expiring JWT tokens, prevent SQL injection, validate uploads, and sandbox code execution securely.",
    "Performance must meet criteria: page loads under 3 seconds, code execution under 10 seconds, AI response under 5 seconds, file upload under 5 seconds for <10MB files."
