# **App Name**: PyCode AI

## Core Features:

- Code Editor: Monaco editor integration with Python syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection.
- File Management: Create, delete, rename, and organize files within projects using a file explorer.
- AI Code Assistant: AI-powered chat assistant for code explanations, error fixes, and optimization suggestions. This AI assistant uses a tool for deciding which quick actions and code context should be offered to the user.
- Code Execution: Execute Python code directly within the editor and display the output in a console.
- Authentication: User authentication system with login, signup, and protected routes.
- Project Management: Create, manage, and save projects to a PostgreSQL database.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vivid blue (#4285F4), evoking both intelligence and approachability. It should feature prominently in the most important CTAs.
- Background color: A very light blue-grey (#F0F4F8), for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: A brighter, but still professional, analogous color. Recommend light blue (#4897F5).
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable interface. Choose 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for the code editor itself.
- Use clean and consistent icons from 'lucide-react' throughout the application.
- Maintain a consistent layout with clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as fade-in effects and hover animations.
